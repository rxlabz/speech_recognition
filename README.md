## [Installation](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/speech_recognition#pub-pkg-tab-installing)

1. Depend on it
Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  speech_recognition: "^0.3.0"
```

2. Install it
You can install packages from the command line:

```
$ flutter packages get
```

3. Import it
Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:speech_recognition/speech_recognition.dart';
```

## Usage

```dart
//..
_speech = SpeechRecognition();

// The flutter app not only call methods on the host platform,
// it also needs to receive method calls from host.
_speech.setAvailabilityHandler((bool result) 
  => setState(() => _speechRecognitionAvailable = result));

// handle device current locale detection
_speech.setCurrentLocaleHandler((String locale) =>
 setState(() => _currentLocale = locale));

_speech.setRecognitionStartedHandler(() 
  => setState(() => _isListening = true));

// this handler will be called during recognition. 
// the iOS API sends intermediate results,
// On my Android device, only the final transcription is received
_speech.setRecognitionResultHandler((String text) 
  => setState(() => transcription = text));

_speech.setRecognitionCompleteHandler(() 
  => setState(() => _isListening = false));

// 1st launch : speech recognition permission / initialization
_speech
    .activate()
    .then((res) => setState(() => _speechRecognitionAvailable = res));
//..

speech.listen(locale:_currentLocale).then((result)=> print('result : $result'));

// ...

speech.cancel();

// ||

speech.stop();
